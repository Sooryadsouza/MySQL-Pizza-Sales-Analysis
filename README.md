MySQL-Pizza-Sales-Analysis 

I'm excited to share my recent project where I used MySQL to analyze pizza sales data. This analysis encompasses basic, intermediate, and advanced levels to derive meaningful business insights.

At the basic level, I calculated the total number of orders, total revenue, identified the highest-priced pizza, determined the most popular pizza size, and listed the top 5 most ordered pizza types.

For the intermediate analysis, I joined tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered, analyzed the distribution of orders by hour, categorized pizza distributions, calculated the average number of pizzas ordered per day, and identified the top 3 pizzas by revenue.

The advanced analysis included calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue, analyzing cumulative revenue over time, and determining the top 3 pizzas by revenue for each category.

This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided actionable business insights.
